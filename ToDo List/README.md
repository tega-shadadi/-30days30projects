**To-Do List Application**
## Description
This is a simple and interactive To-Do List Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It also saves the tasks and their states (e.g., completed or not) in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that the data persists even after refreshing the page.

## Features
1. Add Tasks:

2. Users can add new tasks using the input field and the "+" button or by pressing the "Enter" key.
Delete Tasks:

3. Tasks can be removed by clicking the trash icon next to each task.
Mark Tasks as Completed:

4. Users can click the pen icon to mark tasks as completed, which strikes through the text. The completed state is saved in localStorage.
Persistent Data:

5. Tasks and their completion states are stored in the browser's localStorage, so they remain available even after the page is refreshed.
Notifications:

6. A success notification appears when a task is added or deleted.
Dynamic Rendering:

7. The task list is dynamically updated whenever a task is added, deleted, or marked as completed.
Responsive Design:

8. The application is styled to look good on different screen sizes.
What I Learned
Through this project, I learned and practiced the following concepts:

## HTML:

Structuring a web page with semantic elements.
Using input fields, buttons, and icons for user interaction.

## CSS:

Styling the application using modern CSS techniques.
Using Flexbox for layout and alignment.
Adding hover effects and transitions for better user experience.

## JavaScript:

1. Manipulating the DOM to dynamically add, delete, and update tasks.
Using event listeners to handle user interactions (e.g., button clicks, key presses).
Implementing functions like addItems(), deleteItem(), and strikeThrough() to manage tasks.
Using localStorage to persist data across page reloads.
Handling arrays and objects to store and manage task data.
Debugging:

2. Using console.log() to debug and understand how the application works.
Version Control:

3. Using Git and GitHub to manage the project and publish it online.
Deploying a Website:

4. Publishing the application live using GitHub Pages.
